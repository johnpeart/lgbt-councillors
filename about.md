This website was created to publicly record councillors in local authorities who are LGBT+.

The dataset shows councillors who are ‘out’ as lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or with another minority sexual orientation or gender identity.

Councillors are only included where it is clear that the individual has made an affirmative decision to reveal their identity publicly. This information has been collated from internet searches and publicly available information. Councillors are only listed if a reliable source has been found to verify the individual's identity. These sources might include media reporting or personal testimony.
